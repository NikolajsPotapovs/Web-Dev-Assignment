                The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS). It has grown beyond alphanumeric
                text to include multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) containing digital images, videos, and
                sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and instant messenger
                applications (usually the term is used when on mobile devices).
                Text messages are used for personal, family, business
                and social purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between
                colleagues. In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened
                earlier with emailing.[1] This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and colleagues,
                including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one
                knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and voicemail and unlike calls (in which the
                caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at
                the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with
                automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites, or to participate in online contests.
                Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due
                dates, and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.
